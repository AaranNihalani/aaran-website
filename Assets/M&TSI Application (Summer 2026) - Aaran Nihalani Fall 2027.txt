1. As the Secretary of Eton's Computer Science Society, I am responsible for securing high-quality and engaging speakers to deliver talks to students. Currently, I am working with the COO and Head of Trading Development at XTX to deliver a talk exploring how computer science, mathematics, and data-driven decision making are applied in real-world financial markets, on February 2nd. We expect over three hundred students to attend. I also manage broader engagement with the subject, including teaching introductory robotics lessons to local students using BBC micro:bit robots. During my time as Secretary, I aim to further encourage greater student interest in computer science, particularly its applications across a wide range of fields. I hope to invite speakers who can demonstrate its relevance to wide-ranging disciplines such as medicine, law, defence, and other related industries.
2. This academic year, I founded EC3 (Eton College Computing Club) after identifying a strong interest amongst the student body in machine learning, artificial intelligence, software development and entrepreneurship that has lacked a formal outlet for learning and practical application. We circulated a registration form and received expressions of interest from over 100 students. The club has been running weekly sessions for several months covering topics ranging from competition preparation to machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning. I have enjoyed sharing many areas of personal interest and seeing its value to others. Currently, I am working on organising a hackathon in partnership with the Entrepreneurship Society, aimed at improving the quality of Digital Teaching and Learning at school, where I serve on the committee.
3. As part of the school's CCF (Combined Cadet Force), I am a Lance Corporal and Section Commander, responsible for leading one of the Corps' sections for weekly and off-site training exercises. Training focuses on developing skills, including first aid, navigation, bushcraft and weapons handling. Three times a year, we go off-site to spend the weekend in a military training ground. This academic year, I was put in charge of our platoon of 50+ cadets in our off-site 'harbour', where we also stayed for the night. I was responsible for ensuring operations ran smoothly, setting up the shelter and cooking the rations. I was also in charge of leading the recon mission to gather information about the 'enemy', simulating a real attack. The weekend was an opportunity to use and improve my leadership skills. It was a very full, fast-paced weekend that entailed managing both people and time. Now, we are doing our instructor cadre, building the skills we need to teach the lessons to younger years.
4. Etonomics is the school's economics publication, with over 10,000 monthly readers online. I have contributed six feature articles as a writer. As a Senior Editor, I am responsible for ensuring that the articles are interesting and relevant and editing them to meet the quality standards. I have edited over fifty articles on topics such as economics, public policy and society. I have also spearheaded the Outreach team, a new venture by the club, through which we have developed partnerships with over ten schools encouraging their students to contribute their own economics articles for publication in our magazine.
5. The school's Investment Club manages over £50,000, and we have weekly meetings to discuss the portfolio and potential buys and sells. As a Research Analyst, I deliver reports on stocks that we should buy or sell, including a well-timed report on Alphabet. To further support the club, I volunteered to design and build its website, allowing members to access the portfolio and key updates easily while improving administrative communication and visibility. I have also been selected to help run the club's second annual Investment Challenge. I pushed to make this a national competition, partnering with ten schools for outreach efforts, for which I built the system to collect and manage all the applications and reports that applicants submitted. This year, over 100 teams applied through the club website. I helped to secure judges from the Oxford University Investment Challenge, as well as £50,000 in sponsorship funding for the prize, which will be used to run the challenge over the next five to ten years.

6. Financial awareness and staying up to date are important, yet during a busy day many people do not have time to read a full newspaper. To address this, I am building 'The Morning Report', an app that allows users to input a stock watchlist and the sectors, regions, or industries they are interested in. The app then delivers a one-page, well-formatted PDF report daily by email, containing stock performance data, the five most significant headlines across the past 24 hours, and five personalised headlines tailored to the user's interests. Personalisation is achieved using cosine similarity and intelligent headline filtering to remove
low-quality content before selecting the most relevant and impactful articles. The full product has been built and, after extensive debugging and testing, is now available on the App Store. AWS is used for all of the backend operations of the app, with code and logic optimised to stay within the free compute threshold and minimise operating expenditure.
7. Many import/export companies find that classifying their goods according to the HS classification codes required by the United States is both expensive and time-consuming. As an AI Engineer at Uni Customs, I am working with the founder to complete the final stages of product development ahead of launch. I am fine-tuning LLMs to accurately and confidently classify items to their correct codes at a fraction of the price of human consultants. I was able to apply cutting-edge machine learning and reinforcement learning research to the project, using new techniques recently published on ArXiv like TreeRL and GDPO. We have multiple companies willing to use the product and are entering the final stages of fine-tuning. We are working to complete and deploy the full fine-tuning pipeline, which requires substantial computational resources due to the scale of the model, with over 100 billion parameters and a large volume of training examples. Operating at this scale has been highly instructive, and I have gained significant experience working with advanced platforms and tools.

1. At Meraki Labs, a Humanitarian Consulting Research Lab, I have been interning as a Development Research Intern since February 2025. I have worked on many different projects to contribute to the company and to humanitarian consulting as a whole. My initial task was to write weekly LinkedIn posts summarising reports. These posts doubled their follower count from 600 to 1,200 and resulted in greater engagement and additional contracts. I was later asked to write a full course summary for a programme that trains conflict-affected refugees over the course of a year, to become humanitarian consultants working in their own regions. I also wrote the concept note for the course. When it was sent to various sponsors, it secured over $100,000 in funding to run the programme. I identified a key part of the humanitarian consulting process that is the tagging of qualitative data from interviews with key stakeholders. These stakeholders range from farmers to tribal leaders. I conducted research and selected a large language model that I felt was best suited to this task. I requested training data from Meraki Labs, cleaned and depersonalised the data, and fine-tuned the model. This required far more work and many more iterations than I initially expected. After twenty iterations, during which I documented methodological issues at each stage, I developed a functioning product that accurately and sensitively tagged data. I uploaded the model to Hugging Face and built a web application to enable Meraki Labs and other organisations in the humanitarian consulting space to use the model to accelerate the data analysis process. I later discussed the project with the Capacity Building Manager, who expressed strong interest in using it in live research. He is currently discussing potential applications with the CEO and COO. This project was highly instructive, and I am keen to see how and where this technology is used within the sector over the coming months.
2. Over the summer, I spent three weeks interning remotely from Hong Kong at Jana Small Finance Bank. I was hired as an AI and Data Science Intern under the supervision of the Head of Generative AI and the Head of Data Science. This microfinance bank has many branches in rural areas where the need is the greatest. However, the bank staff are not equipped with the computing skills required to work with software systems. I helped build a system where users could ask natural language questions about the data. This

meant designing an LLM that converted these questions into SQL queries with knowledge of the database schema that would generate clear, interpretable outputs. After completing this step, I was asked to add automatic querying. This required setting up an automatic connection to the database, executing the query, and returning the output to the user. I recognised that it would still be difficult to interpret, since data in a table may not always be the most legible or understandable. To address this, I had a different LLM take in the question, query and database output, and produce a few paragraphs of analysis and suggested action based on the results. The entire system was hosted in a web app with a chatbot layout that was simple and easy to use. Over the winter break, I joined a new project, working on a housing propensity model to make decisions about which customers can take out housing loans. Implementing this with observation and performance windows is important for preventing data leakage. I am excited and hopeful that this project will have a tangible impact on the people whom the bank helps through its various loan products.
3. After interning with Jana Bank, I was struck by the system that helps so many people who aren't able to get small loans from the regular banking system. I became interested in circumstances that lead people to borrow from a formal source like banks, in contrast to an informal source like a moneylender, whose interest rates are often much higher. This led me to write a research paper examining the qualities and factors that determine the availability of credit to small business owners in India. After evaluating a few relevant datasets, I chose the All-India Debt and Investment Survey. The data was hard to work with at the start, with many different tables that had to be merged. After extensive data wrangling and cleaning, I was ready to start the analysis. I used R for programming, as well as for figures and graphs. I then applied econometric and machine learning methods to calculate the Average Marginal Effect values for each available characteristic of an individual borrower. This measures how changes in each characteristic affect the probability that a borrower will borrow formally compared to a reference control group. The findings show that systematic inequality in India persists through the credit system. This paper is currently being peer-reviewed at the International Journal of High School Research, and has been published as a pre-print on SSRN.
4. I have been learning Taekwondo since I was five. Its values of discipline and respect have stayed with me, and the flexibility has been useful for squash and Jiu-Jitsu as well. When I was 9, I earned my junior 1st Dan Black Belt after progressing through all the required patterns and kicks. I earned my adult 2nd Dan Black Belt when I was 15. My coach later suggested that I come in for a few hours to help teach younger students. I found that I really enjoyed it, and I have been returning for weeks at a time whenever I am back in Hong Kong. I have been a coach for over a year and have taught more than 150 children. During this time, I have seen clear improvements in their technique and focus, as well as in how they treat their instructors, peers and parents.

1.	Reflect on a technical or business-related challenge you tackled. Describe what was at stake, your process, and the outcome. What part did you enjoy most? (500 words max)

As part of my internship with Meraki Labs, I was fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) to tag humanitarian consulting qualitative data, mostly from interviews with key players in the research process. When a human does data tagging, it can be hundreds or thousands of sentences, each needing multiple tags and taking many
labour-intensive hours, which ends up being very expensive for the research lab funding the project. Tagging data simply means attaching a label, such as 'Program Efficiency' or 'Challenges', to a particular sentence or phrase, although the tags can be whatever the person tagging wants to call them, as long as they hint towards the main impact of the sentence. This is done to identify trends in the data, telling researchers what and where humanitarian aid should be most directed.
When I was fine-tuning the LLM, with the training examples taken from research projects in Bangladesh and Yemen, there was a training example that caused the model a lot of difficulty. It discussed a ritualistic tribal practice that was performed, but the precise language used was clearly not something it had seen before in its training, so the model delivered nonsensical output. At this point, I looked through the folders of files I had available for the project and came across around thirty documents from interviews and reports about the scenario in question, which would be useful for the model to understand.
I realised that the best way to go about doing this would be Masked Language Modelling, which is akin to covering a particular word in a sentence and getting the model to guess what it is, and updating its weights so it is more likely to output that particular 'token', or word. To see if this would work, I wrote a simple script to extract the text from the documents and performed Masked Language Modelling over a few epochs. This approach proved effective.
When I tested the domain-adapted model afterwards, it was able to understand the sentiment more accurately. It correctly tagged a passage as 'Dangerous Places', despite not having seen the specific term used in the text.
The model is not perfect. To improve reliability, I reduced the tag set from the original 700 to around 50, because the model performed better when each tag was supported by 50 to 100 examples rather than only a handful. There is still bias, with the model overpredicting particular tags. To address this, I created a comprehensive codebook that informs the model of what each tag means, which I reviewed with the CEO to confirm accuracy. For me, the most enjoyable part of the process was watching the model improve with each iteration, even though each training run took nearly six hours and was often frustrating.

1.	Share something about your interests, identity, or personal story that adds context to your application. Why is M&TSI a meaningful next step for you? (500 words or 90-second video).

I rarely get things right on the first attempt, but I have learned to trust what happens after that. Every time I fail, a fire lights up inside me, creating new motivation.
I started Taekwondo when I was 5 years old, and after I got my black belt in 2018, there was a long pause. I decided to start again at the beginning of Year 10, aiming for my 2nd Dan black belt. It was going well until a dubious tackle in a football match put me on crutches, my left knee slightly worse for wear. A few months later, I was in my belt test, having completed everything except for my dreaded speed kicks. Sixty spinning kicks in sixty seconds, with a dodgy knee. The timer beeped. I looked at my coach. Fifty-nine. All of that work to be one kick short. I had one

more chance, otherwise I would be back for the test at Easter. Two minutes later, my face ten shades redder, I passed.
M&TSI's prototype and market plan project is a great way to apply the concepts of iteration to building something high-quality. Recently with The Morning Report, working on a startup of sorts has exposed me more than ever to the business side of a successful venture. Now that I have a functional and deployed app, and the company has been registered, it's time to think about monetisation, user-growth and advertising. The skills M&TSI would help me improve would be really useful for expanding The Morning Report and Uni Customs further, with strategies for each part of the entrepreneurial process.
The soft skills I would gain from M&TSI, particularly through working on a group project with a compelling product idea, would serve me well beyond the programme. Whether it is a final project, senior thesis, or working with a team at a startup or company, effectively delegating roles and moving toward shared goals in a structured way matters. I have learned that I work best in environments where iteration fosters growth. Whether I am building a machine learning model, five games deep in a squash match, or drafting an email to a potential speaker, doing something a little better each time is my favourite part of the process.
The constant feedback and fast-paced environment at M&TSI would be an ideal place to apply the habits I have developed, particularly through the capstone project where iteration is essential to producing a high quality outcome. The emphasis on evaluation and feedback complements my approach to learning, allowing growth to be driven by improving the kick that missed rather than the fifty-nine that landed.
